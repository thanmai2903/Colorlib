          This food website is divided into multiple sections to present each
          product with an accommodating background. Plus, the three-post IG feed
          adds some extra content with posts opening in new tabs.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4 sm:mb-4">

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10">
          Oishii is a trendy food website that doesn’t seem to sell anything
          when scrolling the home page, which is a big plus. Sure, there are
          links to the shop, but they’re done with taste.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          The top bar notification is easily closable by pressing “x,” while the
          header goes from transparent to solid (and floating) on the scroll.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          Below the hero image is a banner with various authority logos linking
          to PR mentions.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4 sm:mb-4">
          Note: Don’t be too salesy; visitors may leave your website early.

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10">
          A Perfect Plate has an appetizing design with content loading on a
          scroll and a floating menu with a drop-down, social icons and a CTA
          button.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          One practical feature is the accordions for “how it works,” which take
          much less space but still provide the necessary information.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          Furthermore, a large section features a single client testimonial to
          build social proof.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4 sm:mb-4">
          Note: Accordions are a great way to introduce additional content and
          information without taking up extra space.

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10">
          Sakara has a likable slider to pause, play, and swipe through at your
          command. Each slide has half an image and half a solid background with
          text and a CTA to make the information more readable.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          The top bar and the header (with mega menu) both stick to the top of
          the screen, so you don’t need to scroll to access the menu – it’s
          always there. Additionally, the footer has multiple columns with an
          app download CTA, subscription and heaps more links.
        </div>

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4 sm:mb-4">
          Note: Allow users to control the slider (because they may find the
          sliding animation too fast).

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10">
          A Fork & A Pencil has a minimalist grid layout with parallax image
          sections and an Instagram feed with a “follow” button.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          The header and the footer are also pretty plain but equip you with all
          the essentials for a better browsing and searching experience.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          Lastly, the newsletter subscription form has reCAPTCHA to prevent
          spam.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4 sm:mb-4">
          Note: If you want to avoid spam (especially when using the contact
          form), use reCAPTCHA.

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10">
          While many use a top bar on a contrasting background to make it stand
          out more, UpNature’s blends with the hero image nicely, not causing
          any distractions. However, only the header with the minimalist mega
          menu floats.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          This food website has a clean, interchanging design (also check these
          winning clean websites), a testimonial slider, and an elementary
          footer.
        </div>

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4 sm:mb-4">
          Note: Use a top bar for special notifications, free shipping, deals,

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10">
          Feastables website proves that there are no limits when it comes to
          creativity and web design. Go as wild and as “crazy” as you want,
          creating a strong and memorable first impression just like Feastables.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          The page has multiple animations and special effects that make it more
          absorbing and exciting, entice you to order the products.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          Besides customer testimonials with star reviews, Feastables also has a
          slider with authority feedback. And if you click on the monster head
          in the right corner, you can play a game, which is something we
          haven’t seen before on a food website.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4 sm:mb-4">

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10">
          Like the Feastables page, Oatly’s home page is very original. Plus,
          instead of scrolling vertically, you scroll horizontally, and even
          though it’s loaded with content, it’s still a fun experience.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          However, you can access other internal pages by pressing the hamburger
          menu icon in the top left corner, which offers additional links and
          social media icons.
        </div>

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4 sm:mb-4">
          Note: Make a website that scrolls horizontally instead of vertically,
          like all the rest.

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10">
          Because Huel is a global brand, they use the top bar to choose your
          location for a more personalized online browsing and shopping
          experience.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          The hero image showcases the product with a title, text, a Trustpilot
          badge and a CTA button for the shop. What will surely trigger your
          attention is the bottom pop-up bar that appears when you start
          scrolling. It wants you to join its ” hooligan” tribe.
        </div>
        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4">
          The home page is content-rich, but the dark and light design makes

        <div className="sm:ml-10 sm:mr-10 sm:mt-4 sm:mb-4">
